1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

    Client-side routing allows for FASTER page loading (AFTER the initial page load) while server-side routing has slower page loading because every request results in a full-page refresh. However, because server-side routing has been the industry standard for so long, it is more optimized for SEO (search engine optimization) when compared to client-side routing.
